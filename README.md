## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The analysis for W. Avy to give a complete picture of what the seasonal weather will be like in Oahu. Having a business withstand cyclical tourist conditions are important. Conditions and timing of busy seasons and diverisfying will help W. Avy with their enterprises. Capturing the data for June and December to make sure the business will have an offset when one aspect has a slower season. 



### Results:

Of the over 3000 temperatures measured, the lowest temperature out of both samples is 56 degrees. That temp might be too cold for ice cream and surfing, but 75% of the temperatures sampled were over 70 degrees. That is definitely warm enough for both activities in both December and June. 

#### Major Differences:

- There are the same amount of days in both months but June temp counts were 200 higher than December's
- The standard deviation of December is 3.7459 vs June is 3.2574. This makes sense because the days start colder in the winter and warm up over the course of the day. 
- The max temp was 85 in June vs December was 83 which means there is still going to be plenty of surfing and ice cream business even in the colder months. But there will be significantly less days that make it up to the 80s so that needs to factor into W. Avy's profitable days. 


### Summary:

W. Avy is making a smart decision to move to Oahu and open up an ice cream and surf shop. They might have to adjust the open to close in the winter to make fiscal sense, but overall its a viable business plan based on the data.
